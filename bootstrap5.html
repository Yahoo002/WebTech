            Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos from his garage in Bellevue,
            Washington,[7] on July 5, 1994. Initially an online marketplace for
            books, it has expanded into a multitude of product categories, a
            strategy that has earned it the moniker The Everything Store.[8] It
            has multiple subsidiaries including Amazon Web Services (cloud
            computing), Zoox (autonomous vehicles), Kuiper Systems (satellite
            Internet), and Amazon Lab126 (computer hardware R&D). Its other
            subsidiaries include Ring, Twitch, IMDb, and Whole Foods Market. Its
            acquisition of Whole Foods in August 2017 for US$13.4 billion
            substantially increased its footprint as a physical retailer.[9]
